#### > about

Web Services Rest designed and developed using Java/Spring technologies.

The Services are related to University World, but they are based on a limited number of entities. 

The project is a **SpringBoot** project, so most of the Configurations are provided by default.

- [ ] Java 11

#### > entities 

- [ ] Student

- [ ] Employee

#### > persistence & repository 

Persistence is represented by the in-memory database called H2.

Classes which implements JPA interfaces have the **Repository** suffix and they allow access to data.
